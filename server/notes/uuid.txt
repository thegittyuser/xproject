The uuid npm package is used to generate universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) in JavaScript in a standard, reliable, and cross-platform way.

What problem uuid solves:
JavaScript does not have a built-in UUID generator that:
    Fully follows the UUID RFC standards
    Works consistently across Node.js and browsers
    Supports multiple UUID versions
The uuid package fills that gap.

What uuid is good for:

1. Generating unique IDs
Used for:
    Database primary keys
    Object identifiers
    Session IDs (non-auth)
    Correlation / request IDs
    Client-generated IDs (offline support)
2. RFC-compliant UUIDs
uuid follows RFC 4122 / RFC 9562 standards:
    Correct version bits
    Correct variant bits
    Proper randomness
Homegrown solutions (Math.random()) do not meet these guarantees.

3. Multiple UUID versions

The package supports:
Version	Purpose
    v1	->  Timestamp + MAC (ordered, but leaks info)
    v3  ->	Name-based (MD5)
    v4  ->	Random (most common)
    v5  ->	Name-based (SHA-1)
    v7  ->	Time-ordered (modern, DB-friendly)

4. Works everywhere
    Node.js
    Browsers
    Edge / serverless
    React, Next.js, mobile web
It automatically uses:
    crypto.randomUUID() when available
    Secure randomness (crypto.getRandomValues) otherwise

When you should use uuid:
    Need unique IDs across systems
    Client-generated IDs
    Distributed systems
    Offline-first apps
    Database keys (especially UUIDv7)
