The crypto-js npm package is used when you need basic cryptographic operations in JavaScript, especially in environments where the Node.js built-in crypto module isn’t available (like browsers).

What crypto-js is good for
1. Browser-compatible cryptography
crypto-js works in:
    Browsers
    Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
2. Simple hashing
Useful for:
    Checksums
    Non-security-critical hashing
    Generating deterministic IDs
3. Symmetric encryption (AES, DES, etc.)
Used for:
    Light client-side data obfuscation
    Encrypting localStorage/sessionStorage
    Sending encrypted payloads when required by legacy APIs
⚠️ Important: This is not secure against a determined attacker if the key is in client-side code.
4. Cross-platform consistency
Same API and output across:
    Browser
    Node.js
    Mobile webviews
This is useful when you must match encryption/hashes between frontend and backend.
